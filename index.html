<h3>Youth</h3>
<p id="pAbout2">Duncannon Fc has a long standing tradition of growing and nurturing younger
    players from under 9s, so that the hard work put into coaching these young people will pay dividends when 
    they reach the Mens Team</p>
    <h3>Current State Of CLub</h3>
    <p id="pAbout3">The club is Doing Well. There Was a tricky patch some years ago
        and the Mens Team dropped down the divisions. But They have been doing well the past years,
        moving up two divisions in Three years. There Is now a drive to raise money for an
        Astroturf Pitch, and fundraising is going ahead for that.
